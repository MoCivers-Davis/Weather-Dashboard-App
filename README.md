## App Overview
The Weather Dashboard App allow users to easily retrieve weather data for multiple cities on demand. The weather app allow users to recive weather data for the curent day to include current temperature, wind speed, humidity, etc... Additionally the app is can be used as a tool for tracking the future five day forecast.  

## Why
The weather app is designed for everyday use and can be beneficial to the genreal public, essentially any one wishing to inquire about current and future weather conditions.  

## How
The weather app is designed utilizng HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and Third-Party-APIs to include the API from OpenWeather.com.

## Challenges
Working with third party API's was a bit of a challenge, specifically getting the 5 day weather forecast to display. Another challenge on mine was activating the cities that were saved in the search history to display current weather conditions again.
